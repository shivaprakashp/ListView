## ListViewOne
Before start with recyclerView, first we used to understand about ListView. Let's we begin with listview with BaseAdapter.
ListView is one of the most used API in android. ListViews are used in Android to show all items in a scrollable list of views. 

Transform Array or Collection of Java Object to list of Android Views. In other terms if we would say Non-UI element to UI elements in android. Adapters are used to achieve the Non-UI elements to UI elements.

As we defined normal listview with ArrayAdpater. 
Defined ListUtils class is used to get array of string values from strings.xml files.
Default, Android listview layout is used to show basic listview works without define any custom adapter.
This works with single unit of string values. But, it won't work with custom layout. 
Custom layout with BaseAdapter will learn in next example.
